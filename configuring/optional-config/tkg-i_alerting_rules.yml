          description: |
            Losing the BOSH Director does not significantly impact the experience of Tanzu Application Service end users. However, this issue means a loss of resiliency for BOSH-managed VMs.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            SSH into the `bosh-health-exporter` VM in the "Healthwatch Exporter" deployment, and view logs to find out why the BOSH Director is failing.

            Issues with Ops Manager health should have no direct end user impacts, however it can can impact an operator's ability to perform an upgrade or to rescale the Tanzu Application Service platform when necessary.

            This might affect the operator's ability to administer changes to the clusters they oversee.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            Identify which clusters are impacted using Kubernetes Cluster Overview dashboard, then view the Cluster Detail dashboard by clicking on the cluster's name in the `Clusters That Might Need Attention` panel to see if API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd are up.
            Identify the corresponding BOSH deployment and investigate the logs for the failing jobs on the master VMs.

          description: |
            Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition SLI Tests run every 1 minute by default. This setting is configurable in Ops Manager and may have been changed. These tests are intended to give Platform Operators confidence that Application Developers can successfully interact with and manage applications in their clusters.
            Note: the sli tests will report a failure if any task (e.g. `login`, `clusters`) takes more than 1 minute to complete.

            Troubleshooting Steps:
            If a failure occurs, attempt to use the failed Kubernetes CLI command in a terminal to see why it is failing.
