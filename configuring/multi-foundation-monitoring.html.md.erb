This topic describes how to configure Healthwatch for VMware Tanzu to monitor multiple Ops Manager foundations.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Multi-Foundation Monitoring

You can monitor several Ops Manager foundations that have VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated
Edition (TKGI) installed from a Healthwatch tile that you install on a separate Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane.

To configure multi-foundation monitoring, see the section for your runtime below:

* [Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TAS for VMs](#multiple-tas-foundations)

* [Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TKGI](#multiple-tkgi-foundations)


## <a id='multiple-tas-foundations'></a> Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TAS for VMs

To configure your Healthwatch deployment to monitor TAS for VMs deployments on multiple Ops Manager foundations from a single monitoring Ops Manager
foundation or the TKGI Control Plane:

1. Install and configure the Healthwatch tile on either an Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane. To install and configure the Healthwatch tile,
see the following topics:
    * [Installing a Tile Manually](../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated
    Pipeline](../installing/automated-pipeline.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring-healthwatch.html)

1. Install and configure Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs on each Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor. To install and configure Healthwatch
Exporter for TAS for VMs, see the following topics:
    * [Installing a Tile Manually](../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated
    Pipeline](../installing/automated-pipeline.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs](configuring-exporter-tas.html)

1. For each installation of Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs, open the ports for the metric exporter VMs that Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs
deploys. For more information about the ports you must open for each metric exporter VM, see [Networking Rules for Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for
VMs](#network-rules-tas) above.

1. Once you have installed Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs and opened the required ports on each Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor, add a scrape
job for each Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile in the **Prometheus** pane of the Healthwatch tile that you installed on your monitoring Ops Manager
foundation or the TKGI Control Plane. To add a scrape job for a Healthwatch Exporter TAS for VMs tile:
  1. Retrieve the Ops Manager root certificate authority (CA) for the Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor. For more information, see the [Ops Manager
  documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/security/pcf-infrastructure/managing-certificates.html#root-certs).
  1. Nagivate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard for the Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor.
  1. Click the **Healthwatch Exporter for Tanzu Application Service** tile.
  1. Select the **Status** tab.
  1. Record the following IP addresses:
      * In the **TAS Counter Exporter** row, record the IP address of the counter metric exporter VM from the **IPs** column.
      * In the **TAS Gauge Exporter** row, record the IP address of the gauge metric exporter VM from the **IPs** column.
  1. Select the **Credentials** tab.
  1. In the row for **Healthwatch Exporter Client Mtls**, click **Link to Credential**.
  1. Record the credentials for **Healthwatch Exporter Client Mtls**.
  1. Navigate to the Healthwatch tile installed on your monitoring Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane.
  1. Select **Prometheus**.
  1. Under **Additional scrape jobs**, click **Add**.
  1. For **Scrape job configuration parameters**, provide the configuration YAML for the scrape job for Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs, similar to the
  following example:

        ```
        job_name: FOUNDATION-NAME
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: https
        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - "GAUGE-EXPORTER-VM-IP-ADDRESS:9090"
            - "COUNTER-EXPORTER-VM-IP-ADDRESS:9090"
        ```
        Where:
        * `FOUNDATION-NAME` is the name of the Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor.
        * `GAUGE-EXPORTER-VM-IP-ADDRESS` is the IP address of the gauge metric exporter VM that you recorded in a previous step.
        * `COUNTER-EXPORTER-VM-IP-ADDRESS` is the IP address of the counter metric exporter VM that you recorded in a previous step.
  1. For **Certificate and private key for TLS**, enter the certificate and private key from **Healthwatch Exporter Client Mtls** that you recorded from the
  **Credentials** tab in the Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs tile in a previous step.
  1. For **CA certificate for TLS**, enter the Ops Manager root CA that you retrieved in a previous step.
  1. For **Target server name**, enter the name of the server that facilitates TLS communication between the Prometheus instance in the Healthwatch tile and
  the metric exporter VMs that Healthwatch Exporter for TAS for VMs deploys.


## <a id='multiple-tkgi-foundations'></a> Configure Multi-Foundation Monitoring for TKGI

In order to monitor TKGI deployments on multiple Ops Manager foundations from a single monitoring Ops Manager foundation or the TKGI Control Plane, you must
configure federation for your Healthwatch deployment.

To configure your Healthwatch deployment to monitor TKGI deployments on multiple Ops Manager foundations from a single monitoring Ops Manager foundation or
the TKGI Control Plane:

1. Install and configure the Healthwatch and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tiles on each Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor. To install and configure
the Healthwatch and Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tiles, see the following topics:
    * [Installing a Tile Manually](../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated
    Pipeline](../installing/automated-pipeline.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring-healthwatch.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI](configuring-exporter-tkgi.html)

1. Install and configure the Healthwatch tile on your monitoring foundation. To install and configure the Healthwatch tile, see the following topics:
    * [Installing a Tile Manually](../installing/installing-manually.html) or [Installing, Configuring, and Deploying a Tile Through an Automated
    Pipeline](../installing/automated-pipeline.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch](configuring-healthwatch.html)
    * [Configuring Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI](configuring-exporter-tkgi.html)

1. Configure the Healthwatch tile on each Ops Manager foundation you monitor to scrape the Healthwatch Exporter for TKGI tile installed on the same
foundation. To configure scrape jobs in Healthwatch, see [Configure Prometheus](configuring-healthwatch.html#prometheus) in _Configuring Healthwatch_.

1. Configure the Healthwatch tile on your monitoring foundation to federate metrics from the Healthwatch tiles installed on the Ops Manager foundations you
want to monitor. To configure federation for your Healthwatch deployment, see [Configuring Federation for Healthwatch](optional-config/federation.html).

1. Configure TKGI cluster discovery in the Healthwatch tile on each Ops Manager foundation you want to monitor. Do not configure TKGI cluster discovery in the
Healthwatch tile on your monitoring foundation. To configure TKGI cluster discovery on the Ops Manager foundations you want to monitor, see [Configuring TKGI
Cluster Discovery](optional-config/configuring-cluster-discovery.html).
